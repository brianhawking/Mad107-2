Fibonacci Recipe

Objectve: Print out fibonacci numbers up to a max value 

Ingredients (Variables):

	1. var fibonacciNumbers:[Int] - array that will store all the fibonacci numbers

	2.  Within calculateFibonacciNumbers
		i. var index - keep track of index of array
		ii. var fibonacci - updated list of fibonacci numbers less than maxNumber

Directions:

	1. func calculateFibonacciNumbers(max: Int) -> [Int]

		The function will take in the max number.  And output an array containing all the Fibonacci numbers up to max number.

	2. Fibonacci numbers start with f1 = 1, f2 = 1.  The next number in the sequence is calculated by the sum of the two previous numbers. 

		f3 = f2 + f1
		f4 = f3 + f2
		f5 = f4 + f3 
		etc. 

	3. Create an array with [1,1] as the first two members

	4. If the sum of the two most current numbers is less than maxNumber then add the new number to the Fibonacci list

	5. If the sum of the two most current numbers is greater than or equal to maxNumber then exit loop and return array
